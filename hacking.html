      </center>
      <p class= "style"> To be able to hack your Switch you should first visit <a href="https://www.ismyswitchpatched.com">this site</a> in order to learn if your Switch is hackable or not. If it
      says that your Switch is not patched than you can continue with this guide, but if your Switch is patched than your only option is a modchip called SX CORE or SX LITE which can be found in Aliexpress.</p>
   <br><h1 style="color:red;font-size:30px;"> Phase 1: Setting Up the SD Card</h1>
      <p class="style"> Step 1: Make sure that you have at least 32 GB (64 GB+ Recommended) space on your SD Card.
        <br>Step 2: Download the latest <a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases">Atmosphere</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases">Hekate</a>.
        <br>Step 3: Download and setup <a href="https://github.com/eliboa/TegraRcmGUI/releases">TegraRCMGUI</a> for Windows, for other platforms use <a href="https://webcfw.sdsetup.com/">this Online Injector</a>.
        <br>Step 4: Format your SD Card to FAT32.
        <br>Step 5: Copy Atmsophere and Hekate files (only Botloader folder on Hekate) to SD Card.
       <br><h1 style="color:red;font-size:30px;"> Phase 2: Start Hacking the Switch</h1>
        Step 6: Plug your SD Card back to your Switch.
        <br>Step 7: Insert your jig (buyable from internet for around 2$).
        <br>Step 8: Press + and power button to get into RCM.
        <br>Step 9: Plug your Switch to your PC and open your payload injector.
        <br>Step 10: Install drivers if you are using TegraRCMGUI. Choose Hekate payload (.bin file) that you have downloaded and then inject it.
        <br>Step 11: Create a backup from Hekate Menu.
        <br>Step 12: Enable AutoRCM from Hekate.
        <br> Step 13: Close your Switch and move the backup you just created to your PC. Make sure to have multiple copies of your backup on different devices like an external Hard Disk.
        <br> Step 14: Get into Hekate again as mentioned above, but now you do not need to use jig.
        <br> Step 15: Create a EmuMMC as Hidden Partition from Hekate.
        <br> Step 16: Click Launch and then choose "CFW EmuMMC".
